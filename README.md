spritewell
==========

Spritewell composes a set of input images into a single sheet.  Spritewell is a go library and not for direct 
consumption on the cli.  [Wellington](http://godoc.org/github.com/wellington/wellington) uses this project.

Check out the docs: http://godoc.org/github.com/wellington/spritewell

Currently two different types of positioning are available, Horizontal and Vertical.  Padding between images is also supported.
